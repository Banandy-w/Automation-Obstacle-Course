# Goals
* Practice automation by running through challenges found here https://obstaclecourse.tricentis.com/Obstacles/List
* Do NOT implement a Page Object Model so you can further familiarize yourself with selenium or whatever framework used.

# Improvements needed
* When running the program, it should give the user an option to try the obstacle and then automate it after some user input.
